My name is Brandon Fredley. I currently live in Herriman, Utah (suburb of Salt Lake) but originally from Kansas. I have been married for 9 and 1/2 years and have 3 children two girls (7,6) and 1 boy (2).

I am pursuing a web design and development degree with an emphasis in design. I have been on the slow track to graduate up until this semester. In March I got laid off from my job and have felt that it was a motivation for me to spend more time on school and change careers.

Previously I was a 2D/3D motion graphics and visual effects artist. I still do some occasional freelance work but my main focus is on school. I eventually want to become a UX designer. I love design and creating and want to create great experiences for people. I haven't done much with CIT just the prerequisite course.
